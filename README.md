# packetsniffer
## Overview
This is an implementation of a packet sniffer in C. The goal of my project is to be able to intercept HTTP packets and return basic information on insecure users. I am using this project to gain experience developing in Linux and Vim as well as to gain knowledge in server-side computing. I am planning to make a few tutorial socket programs to understand the basics of network programming, and then I will start to develop sniffer.c
